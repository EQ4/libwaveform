- check XDG env var works
- paths for peak.vert and peak.frag
- change pool window to use wf_peak_render_to_pixbuf.
- why do we have each actor having its own viewport? should it belong to the canvas?
	- document the reasons why this is so.
- both texture mode and shader modes have spurious lines.
- actor test is too slow at high zoom.
- fix paths for test wavs
- test installation, test ebuild
- remove all stdout
- documentation
- peak.c / peak.h need renaming
- check copyright notices

later:

- cairo / clutter
- vgain
- iso mode
- api:
	- n_frames property - should we guarantee that it is always correctly set?
	- wf_get_audio_async -- review api
- the current texture mode is no use as it doesnt show full peak at low zoom.
- better testing of audio cache full behaviour.
- check that hi-res painting falls back to lo res while waiting for audio to load.
- implement usage of textures in hi res mode.
- v low res mode: for a long file we use loads of textures! at v low zoom this is v inefficient.
	- would it be a problem if the v-lo-res-texture size was bigger than the audio-block size?
	- what is best resolution for this mode?
		- x 16 ? 1 texture is 16s - would not be used much until file length was approx 1 minute or more

		c/w:
			normal mode: 1 texture is v approx 1s.
