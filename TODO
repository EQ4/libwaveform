- test with Nouveau driver
- add pkgconfig pc file
- both texture mode and shader modes have spurious lines.
- fix paths for test wavs (can get dir of current executable?)
- remove all stdout
- documentation
- peak.c / peak.h need renaming (split?)

later:

- lv2
- grid lines
- cairo / clutter
- vgain
- iso mode
- use textures in hi-res mode
- api:
	- n_frames property - should we guarantee that it is always correctly set?
	- wf_get_audio_async -- review api
- the current texture mode is no use as it doesnt show full peak at low zoom.
- better testing of audio cache full behaviour.
- check that hi-res painting falls back to lo res while waiting for audio to load.
- implement usage of textures in hi res mode.
