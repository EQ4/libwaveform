- check pixbuf inset at hi res
- fix hires segfault with Nouveau driver (status?)
- test pkgconfig file, and header file installation
- both texture mode and shader modes have spurious lines.
- documentation
- peak.c / peak.h need renaming (split?)
- left and right are swapped in some cases.

later:

- add api to handle changes to the wave for editor apps.
- rms display
- lv2
- grid lines / text labels
- cairo / clutter
- vgain
- api:
	- n_frames property - should we guarantee that it is always correctly set?
	- wf_get_audio_async -- review api
- the current texture mode is no use as it doesnt show full peak at low zoom.
- better testing of audio cache full behaviour.
- check that hi-res painting falls back to lo res while waiting for audio to load.
- implement usage of textures in hi res mode.
- maybe include the shaders as part of the library object instead of being separate files.
- texture purging is too agressive? for browser applications, textures shouldnt be removed as soon as the Waveform is free'd.
- fbo textures are RGBA but only need to be alpha maps (at least in the main case)
